# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-on-MNIST-Dataset
Various architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks were created and tested on MNIST data.Advanced Techniques like Dropout,Momentum and Batch Normalization etc were used while creating the architecture of the Model.Using Convnet with a drop out rate of 0.2 helped me to achieve 99.39 % Accuracy on test or Validation data
